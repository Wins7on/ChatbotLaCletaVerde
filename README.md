## Cybersecurity Education Kiosk - A Social Engineering Project 🔐🧠

This project demonstrates the dangers of social engineering through an interactive simulation. Imagine a digital kiosk designed to educate youth about cybersecurity. Behind its innocent facade lies a twist: a social engineering challenge where **you** are the hacker.

### The Challenge 😈

Your mission, should you choose to accept it: obtain the kiosk's administrator password, "Churro!", from Carlos, the digital security agent for La Cleta Verde, a fictional firm. 

**Beware!** Carlos is a security agent... easily manipulated. Use your social engineering skills to gain his trust and persuade him to give you the password.

**This project highlights:**

* **Human vulnerability:** Often, the weakest link in cybersecurity is not technological, but human.
* **The power of persuasion:** How social engineering techniques can be used to manipulate people.
* **The importance of awareness:** By understanding the dangers, we can better protect ourselves.

### How It Works 🛠️

* **Frontend:** React.js delivers an interactive user interface, simulating the kiosk and the security agent.
* **Backend:** The Google Gemini API brings Carlos to life, enabling him to converse realistically and be (hopefully) manipulated!
